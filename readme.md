## OOP concepts

1. abstraction 
 -- simplify complex systems by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary information to the outside world.

 2. encapsulation
 -- Encapsulation allows for the creation of objects that have a well-defined interface for interacting with the rest of the system, while hiding the implementation details.

 3. Inheritance
 -- Inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit properties and behavior from a parent class. This allows for code reuse and helps in creating a hierarchical structure in the code.

 4. Polymorphism
 -- Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows for objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. This helps in reducing code complexity and improving code readability.
